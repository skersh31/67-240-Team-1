                            This article examines the limitations of traditional archives in fostering social liberation and proposes a collaborative approach to forgetting. It uses the Pittsburgh Queer History Project (PQHP) as a case study to illustrate how community archives can challenge the authority of institutional archives.
                            By shifting from a custodial model to a decentralized preservation service, the PQHP demonstrates the potential of community archives to critically reassess the role of institutional archives in creating a more comprehensive and conscious history.
    
                            <br><br>The article argues that while community archives are increasingly valued, they are often pressured to conform to institutional recordkeeping practices, which can undermine their potential for social change.

                            The Pittsburgh Queer History Project (PQHP) began as an 
                            urban archaeological dig of an abandoned after-hours social 
                            club. The detritus collected helped construct a history of 
                            working-class Pittsburgh, including the lives and labor of 
                            trans bodies in the Steel City. A recent exhibition by the 
                            PQHP, Lucky after Dark, presented a cross-section of this 
                            archive, including a newly acquired slide collection from 
                            social clubs between 1967 and 1990. Amounting to several 
                            thousand photographs taken at three clubs owned by Robert 
                            “Lucky” Johns, as well as hundreds of hours of video, it
                             is a uniquely rich documentation of a subcultural community 
                             spanning over thirty years. The author discusses a critical 
                             shift in my handling of these archival materials, beginning 
                             with a slide show entitled “The $10,000 Woman.” The incorporation 
                             of oral histories by trans women in the photograph archive turned 
                             what was originally indexed as a record of gay entertainment into 
                             a nuanced narration of transsexual history in 1970s Pittsburgh.

Since then, the PQHP has developed more academic and popular publications, events, as well as select archival collections online.

They received their PhD in Gender & Women’s Studies from the University of Arizona. Their work examines local histories of voluntary associations and ‘drinking clubs’ as the context for the Pittsburgh Queer History Project’s archives. Their work asks why these materials come together as a community archives, beyond their relationship to sexual identity,  working with the overlapping meanings of “membership” that circulate in the PQHP’s records.

                            <span class="highlight">Dr. Tim Haggerty</span> is currently the Director of the Humanities Scholars Program, an interdisciplinary honors program in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon as well as an adjunct professor in History.

                            Broadly, his research interests examine changing roles of masculinity and the role of the state in formulating male identities in the nineteenth and twentieth century. This research has produced work that examines new cultural roles for men, as well as examining policy issues concerning sexuality and military service.
                            Besides his historical work, his satirical commentary appears in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette frequently. In support of his dissertation research, he was awarded a Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship, and, with Jared Day, has received support from the New-York Historical Society and the Bibliography Society of America to support current work on the satirical newspapers of antebellum New York.                        </p>
